Overview
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is becoming increasingly difficult. This dataset investigates how a person's weight category relates to their daily routines, eating habits, physical activity, and demographic information. Building models that can correctly categorize people into groups like inadequate weight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity levels is the task assigned to participants.

Features like age, gender, family history, food consumption patterns, physical activity, technology use, and modes of transportation are all included in the dataset. It is a realistic and difficult problem that combines machine learning, behavioral science, and healthcare because of these various factors.

Your objective is to create predictive models that can reveal hidden trends in lifestyle choices and advance knowledge of the risk factors for obesity and overweight.
